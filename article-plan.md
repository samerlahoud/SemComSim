Basic Simulation Results Structure
Let's start with your basic comparison simulation and structure the results for your paper:
Expected Key Results (from your basic simulation):

Efficiency Superiority: EXP3 bandit should achieve similar PSNR to Fixed Heavy but with ~30-40% fewer total epochs
Adaptive Learning: Strategy selection should evolve over rounds, initially exploring then converging to efficient strategies
Robustness: Better performance than Random and Fixed Light under varying conditions
Resource Awareness: Lower-end devices should naturally converge to lighter strategies
